Notes for Pruuart_Int:

Hardware:

Beaglebone Black A5
ADAFRUIT Ultimate GPS

Software:

Debian version 2014-07-16 3.8.13-bone60
gcc

Texas Instruments "am335x_pru_package-master"
pasm (PRUSS assembler)

Hardware connections:


pin p9.4 on BBB to VIN on GPS
pin p8.1 on BBB to GND on GPS
pin p9.17 on BBB to Rx on GPS
pin p9.18 on BBB to Tx on GPS


Devicetree:

pruuart-00A0.dts - enables the PRUSS and:

                               configures P9.17 (ofset 0x95C) for PRU Output.
                               Mode 4, Output = 0x04

                               configures P9.18 (ofset 0x958) for PRU Input.
                               Mode 4, Input = 0x24

Program:

puri.c - initializes the PRU, waits for signal from PRUSS, reads data from PRU0 local data memory and prints the data

puri.p - initalizes the PRU uart, reads data until nl, on receipt of nl, writes terminating NULL and signals the linux side.
             Uart signals PRU when a character has been received.

====================================

             The Interrupt system of the PRU takes 64 System Event and maps these events (SysEvts) to 9 channels.  The 9 channels are then mapped to 9 Host interrupts. A host is the PRU or Linux running on the main processor.  Refer to page 153 of the AM335x PRU-ICSS Reference Guide.  In section 7 there is a list of the System Events.  Note that by default the PRU enables the MII-RT set.  You must set the MII_RT register, see section 10.  Host Interrupts 0 & 1 are reserved for
the PRU and appear on r31.t30 & r31.t30.  The other 7 Host Interrupts are sent to Linux.

             I could only receive SysEvt #6 from the Uart interrupt. Note that according to section 8.2.8.1 all Uart interrupts are multiplexed and sent as one signal.  This may be why #4 Uart Rx, didn't work for me.

             The C program puri.c uses the prussdrv library to initalize the PRU interrupt system and map a System Event from
the PRU to Linux.  So in this example, puri.p doesn't have to do the full initalization.
